## About

Hi, I'm Sam! 

I am a Business Intelligence Analyst, based in Berlin, with a background in the travel industry and education. I hold a Bachelor's degree (B.A.) in Modern Languages (Spanish & French) and a Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE), specialising in Secondary Education. During my 5 years in the travel industry, with [GetYourGuide](https://www.getyourguide.co.uk/), I have worked as a Customer Service Agent, a Team Lead and a Quality Assurance Manager before transitioning over to an Operations Analyst in November 2021.

This repository is to showcase skills, share projects and track my journey in Data Analytics.

## Portfolio Projects
Below are some of the data analytic projects I have worked on.

### Company Sales and Operations Analysis
**Code:** [`video_games_sales.ipynb`](https://github.com/nktnlx/data_analysis_portfolio/blob/main/video_games_sales.ipynb)    
**Presentation:** [`my_project_slides.pdf`](https://github.com/nktnlx/data_analysis_course/blob/main/37_final_project/my_project_slides.pdf)   
**Description:** The dataset contains 16715 records as of 2016. There is a list of video games with sales (by region), year of release, platform, critics and users score. The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, filling missing values, EDA (exploratory data analysis), analyzing region based user profiles, measuring statistical factors, hypothesis testing.  
**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, descriptive statistics, central limit theorem, hypothesis testing, data visualization.  
**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy Stats, Seaborn, Matplotlib.  
**Results:** Review of the global and regional video games markets, data-based business recommendations.  

## Study Projects
In this section I will provide links to my github repositories containing code and jupyter notebooks I created while passing online courses or was just having fun with.

### sklearn ML course
**Description:** Machine Learning in Python with scikit-learn by France Université Numérique. [The course official page](https://www.fun-mooc.fr/en/courses/machine-learning-python-scikit-learn/).  
This 3 month course is an in-depth introduction to predictive modeling with scikit-learn. Step-by-step and didactic lessons introduce the fundamental methodological and software tools of machine learning, and is as such a stepping stone to more advanced challenges in artificial intelligence, text mining, or data science.  
**Repository:** Check the repository having jupyter notebooks with the course lectures and tasks' solutions ---> [go to repo..](https://github.com/nktnlx/sklearn_ml_course)  
**Status:** in progress..  

### Kaggle 30 Days of ML
**Description:** 30 days of Machine Learning by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/thirty-days-of-ml). The course rapidly covers the most essential skills needed to get hands dirty with data and quickly learn how to build machine learning models.  
**Repository:** Check the repository having jupyter notebooks with the course tasks' solutions ---> [go to repo..](https://github.com/nktnlx/kaggle_30_Days_of_ML)
